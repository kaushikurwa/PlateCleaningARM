# Plate Cleaning Robot using ABB IRB 120

##  üìåOverview

This project showcases an automated plate-cleaning system developed using the ABB IRB 120 industrial robotic arm. Leveraging numerical inverse kinematics and a PD control strategy, the robot performs precise spiral cleaning motions over randomly positioned plates in a defined workspace.

The system emphasizes:
- **Numerical Inverse Kinematics (IK)** for precise joint angle computation.
- **Proportional-Derivative (PD) Control** for smooth trajectory following.
- **Spiral Trajectory Planning** to replicate manual scrubbing.
- **Cubic Polynomial Transitions** for safe, efficient movement between plates.

##  üõ†Ô∏èFeatures

- **Task Space Definition:** Ensures safe operation by excluding robot base area.
- **Random Plate Position Generation:** Places multiple plates with no overlap and safe spacing.
- **Spiral Cleaning Path:** Cleans each plate using a widening spiral.
- **Shortest Path Optimization:** Chooses the next nearest plate to minimize time.
- **Collision-Free Transitions:** Uses smooth, collision-avoiding paths.
- **Real-Time Simulation:** Visualizes cleaning and transition motions in MATLAB.

##  üß©System Flow

1. **Initialize Robot:** ABB IRB 120 starts at origin with zero joint configuration.
2. **Generate Plates:** Random positions within workspace.
3. **Clean Plates:** Spiral trajectory cleans each plate thoroughly.
4. **Transition:** Cubic polynomial path moves to next nearest plate.
5. **Loop:** Repeat until all plates are cleaned.
